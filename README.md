# House_Price_Prediction
This project uses a linear regression model using five different parameters to predict the price of houses.

After comparing the values of Mean Absolute errors of the five parameters namely sqft_living, sqft_lot, sqft_above, yr_built, floors, 
We can infer that the linear regression model consisiting of price and sqft_living is the most accurate with a Mean Absolute error of 8.01952622105321
